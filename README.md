## Description

My motivation for this project was that I needed a place to store my assignments/tasks and be able to sort them efficiently. That motivation was the reason I built this project so i set out to create a website that I can list my tasks and their due dates and appropriately sort them into their urgency. It solves the problem of not being able to efficently sort your tasks and be able to move them around depending on their urgency and due date. I learned how to correctly implement dragging cards and dropping them around in a form format and I got a chance to implement all my javascript skills i've learned recently.

## Usage

To use this webpage I've created you just need to click the green add task button like seen in the first photo then fill out the "title", "description", and use the calendar to pick your "task due date". It will then be logged into the "todo" collumn and you can drag and drop the card into the other collumns to sort them.
